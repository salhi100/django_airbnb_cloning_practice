# 3. Building Users Applications: /users directory

### Creating Apps

```shell
 django-admin startapp [appname]
```

- since app contains multiple functions, appname should be in plural form
- names of .py files in application folder is not optional. You can't change names
- for example, users app has create password, update password

### How to make Users Application

- replacing django user with my user
- Python is object programming language: class can be inherited!
- CMD + click to check Abstractuser class
- Django makes migration by itself, so we don't have to write sql

```shell
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

- Django has database fields for everything: email field, text field... Just call for fields.

- installing module on python virtual environment SHOULD NOT BE DONE WITH pip. 
  Use pipenv

  ``` shell
  pipenv install Pillow
  ```

### models.py: All the fields are translated into database stuff.

- **[Refer to models.py fields document on Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/models/fields/).** 
- textfield: yields text field without limit on webpage
- charfield: yields text field with limit of single line webpage
- datefield: yields calendar selection on webpage
- boolean field: true of false checkbox

### admin.py: Admin Panel 

- **[Refer to admin.py fields document document on Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/contrib/admin/)**
- admin.py regards about admin panel of the website. 
- you can create filter(like excel) for fields in table: such as currency or superhost



# [4. Building Rooms Applications](./rooms)

## [Refer to cloning webpage. Rooms App's functions are: ](*https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/22320269?location=Seoul&source_impression_id=p3_1581697502_PpMPhvPC73I2KD%2BU*)

- room register
- room photo upload
- describing room's specifications(price, option, type...)

## [Making Core Application](./core)

- This is application that is not visible to users. 

  - The purpose of this app is to simplify repetetive calling onto certain model: such as timestamp
    - [In this app's models.py, we made TimeStamped class](./core/models.py) as subject for the call up
    - [TimeStamped class](./core/models.py) will be used in all the other apps.
    - [On the other hand, Users app imported AbstractUser class from Django default models only](./users/models.py).

- All the other application names should be plural, except for this kind of application.

- In other apps' models.py, you can import Core Application's models along with default django models

  ```python
  #importing django default models as class
  from django.db import models 
  
  #importing Core Application's models as class
  from core import models as core_models #"as" is like "import pandas as pd"
  ```

## WorkFlow when creating Rooms app

### 1. [At project's settings.py](./settings.py), install apps that I built. This is to let Django project know which are apps.py to use for the project.

``` python
# Letting Django know my established Project apps by stating here.
# Importing apps.py in each apps: core, users, rooms, reviews ...
PROJECT_APPS = [
    "core.apps.CoreConfig",
    "users.apps.UsersConfig",
    "rooms.apps.RoomsConfig",
]

# Put users auth at the end
AUTH_USER_MODEL = "users.User"
```



### 2. [At individual application's models.py,](./rooms/models.py) shape database & connect between tables of other application's models.py

- **Write packages / modules in order**

``` py
# first django
from django.db import models

# second third party apps
from django_countries.fields import CountryField

# third my applications
from core import models as core_models
```

- **[Foreign Key (one to multiple) in models.py](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/fields/)**
  - foreign key is connecting one model to the many other. source of the connection is user, and it connects to multiple rooms.
  - Room database(or table) looks like this ![image-20200215131251118](/Users/noopy/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20200215131251118.png)
  - Foreign Key(FK:USER) calls data from another database(or sheet), which is user table.
    ![image-20200215131329179](/Users/noopy/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20200215131329179.png)

  - For example, many instagram posts per user or many youtube posts per google user.

- **[Many to Many Relationship in models.py](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/fields/)**
  - models.ManyToManyField(<>)
- All of other classes above are inherited in Room class

``` python
# Shaping Database(or table) of rooms
# All of classes above are inherited here.
class Room(core_models.TimeStampedModel):

    """ Room Model Definition """

    # when requiring fill up, don't put blank=True
    # Below are different types of fields that we can utilize

    #Charfield and textfield
    name = models.CharField(max_length=140)
    city = models.CharField(max_length=80)
    description = models.TextField()
    
    #country field is inhereted from third party
    country = CountryField()

    
    #integerfield example
    price = models.IntegerField()
    address = models.CharField(max_length=140)
    guests = models.IntegerField()
    beds = models.IntegerField()
    bedrooms = models.IntegerField()
		
    #timefield example
    check_in = models.TimeField()
    check_out = models.TimeField()
    
    #booleanfield(checkbox) example
    instant_book = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    
    # foreignkey field
    host = models.ForeignKey("users.User", on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    room_type = models.ForeignKey("RoomType", on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)
    

```

### 3. [At individual application's admin.py](./rooms/admin.py), register table models that you built previously.  

``` python
from django.contrib import admin
from . import models  # from the same folder, import the application's models

# refer to ./models.py for which models to register
# registering multiple models at once
@admin.register(models.RoomType, models.Facility, models.Amenity, models.HouseRule)
class ItemAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):

    """ Item Admin Definition """

    pass
```



### 4. Since we shaped tables in models.py & reflected change of database on admin panel, makemigrations and migrate

```shell
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. At the webpage, check Admin panel.

![image-20200216003543786](/Users/noopy/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20200216003543786.png)

### 6. [At individual application's models.py,](./rooms/models.py) setup verbose name to forcefully designate names that is displayed on Admin webpage.

![image-20200216004144914](/Users/noopy/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20200216004144914.png)
